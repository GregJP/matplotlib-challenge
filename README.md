# matplotlib-challenge

### This is an assignment from the UNC Data Science Bootcamp. In this assignment we were asked provide summary tables and graphs that represented the data of mice that were treated with different drug regimens in effort to determine the effectiveness of the specific regimens. The assignment was guided to use methods that were taught in the Matplotlib portion of the bootcamp.
